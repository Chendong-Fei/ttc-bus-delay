clean this data: fill all the blank space with NA, create a new target variable "delay"(if Min_delay >0, mark 1 otherwise, 0) delete min_delay and min_gap
ChatGPT

Generated by DALL·E
Here is the R code to clean the data as you requested. It assumes that the CSV file is named ttc-bus-delay-data-2024.csv.
R
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Set file path
file_path <- "ttc-bus-delay-data-2024.csv"

# Read the data
data <- read.csv(file_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Replace blank spaces with NA
data[data == ""] <- NA

# Create the new target variable "delay"
data <- data %>%
  mutate(delay = ifelse(Min_delay > 0, 1, 0))

# Remove the columns "Min_delay" and "Min_gap"
data <- data %>%
  select(-Min_delay, -Min_gap)

# Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file
write.csv(data, "ttc-bus-delay-data-2024-cleaned.csv", row.names = FALSE)

print("Data cleaning complete. Cleaned file saved as 'ttc-bus-delay-data-2024-cleaned.csv'.")
Instructions:
Save the provided script into an R script file (e.g., clean_data.R).
Run the script in an R environment where the CSV file is located.
The cleaned file will be saved as ttc-bus-delay-data-2024-cleaned.csv.

i want produce this graph show each variables as y-axis, and estimate coefficient as x-axis
ChatGPT

Generated by DALL·E
To produce a plot similar to the one shown, where each variable appears on the y-axis and the coefficient estimates (with confidence intervals) are on the x-axis, you can modify the code as follows:

Updated R Code:
r
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Logistic Regression: Predicting delay based on selected variables
logit_model <- glm(delay ~ Date + Time + Route + Direction + Day + Vehicle, 
                   data = data, 
                   family = "binomial")

# Extract coefficients and confidence intervals
coefficients_df <- tidy(logit_model, conf.int = TRUE)

# Exclude intercept for cleaner visualization
coefficients_df <- coefficients_df %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)")

# Plot coefficients with confidence intervals
ggplot(coefficients_df, aes(x = estimate, y = term)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high), height = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Coefficient Estimates with Confidence Intervals",
       x = "Coefficient Estimate",
       y = "Predictor") +

Can you give the code of Delay Distribution by Incident Type
ChatGPT

Here is the code:
data$delay <- as.factor(data$delay)  # Convert delay to a factor (binary: 0 or 1)
data$Incident <- as.factor(data$Incident)

# Generate the violin plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Incident, y = as.numeric(as.character(delay)))) +
  geom_violin(
    aes(fill = Incident),  # Add color for distinction
    scale = "width",       # Scale violin widths by group size
    alpha = 0.7            # Add transparency for aesthetics
  ) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = 0.2,           # Add boxplot inside the violin
    outlier.shape = NA,    # Hide outliers to avoid overlap
    color = "black"

    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),                         # Adjust y-axis font size
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11),                        # Adjust x-axis title font size
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),                        # Adjust y-axis title font size
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")            # Adjust title font size
  )

why there is no line in the graph
ChatGPT

Generated by DALL·E
The absence of a line in the graph indicates that the average_delay_by_hour data frame might be empty, or it lacks valid data to plot. Here's how to debug and fix the issue:

Debugging Steps
Check the Hour Column: Ensure that the Hour column is correctly extracted from the Time column and contains valid numeric values.

head(data$Hour)
unique(data$Hour)
If the Hour column contains NA or invalid values, recheck the Time column format.
Inspect average_delay_by_hour: Check if average_delay_by_hour has data:


print(average_delay_by_hour)
If it is empty, inspect the delay column to ensure it has valid numeric values (0 or 1).
Check Data Aggregation: Verify if the grouping and summarizing step is working as expected:

table(data$Hour)  # Check the distribution of hours
If hours are not distributed correctly, the aggregation will fail.
Check for NA Values: Ensure there are no NA values in Hour or delay:

sum(is.na(data$Hour))
sum(is.na(data$delay))

Can you explain scatter plots for vehicles.
ChatGPT

Generated by DALL.E
Scatter plots for vehicles are used to visualize the relationship between two or more variables in a dataset. In the context of this dataset, a scatter plot might display the number of vehicles (y-axis) against routes (x-axis), with additional features like color or size representing another variable, such as delays.

Explanation of the Key Features:
X-Axis (Routes): Each unique value on the x-axis corresponds to a route. This allows us to examine differences or trends in vehicle counts across various routes.

Y-Axis (Vehicle Counts): The y-axis shows the count of vehicles associated with each route. This provides insights into the distribution and variability of vehicle use.

Color and Size (Delay Information): Points can be colored or sized based on whether delays occurred. For example:

Blue for routes with delays.
Red for routes without delays.
Clusters or Patterns: Scatter plots allow us to identify clusters, trends, or outliers in the data. For instance:

Routes with consistently high vehicle counts might indicate busy areas.
Routes with frequent delays can be flagged for further investigation.

Can you generate a proper survey about the ttc bus delay
ChatGPT

Generated by DALL.E
The survey will be distributed using targeted approaches for each group of respondents. For operators and experts, email invitations will be sent through professional organizations or transit unions to ensure the survey reaches qualified individuals. Passengers will be engaged through public outreach on transit platforms, mobile apps, and in-station posters. To encourage participation, QR codes and online links will be provided for easy access. As an incentive, operators and experts will receive a small honorarium for their time, while passengers will have the chance to win transit credits or discounts. The survey will be conducted over a span of four weeks, ensuring responses capture a range of operational conditions, including weekdays and weekends.

 regression_results <- tidy(logit_model)
Error in tidy(logit_model) : could not find function "tidy"
ChatGPT

Generated by DALL.E
The error occurs because the tidy function is part of the broom package, which may not be installed or loaded in your R environment. To resolve this issue:

Steps to Resolve
Install the broom Package: If you don’t have the broom package installed, you can install it using:

install.packages("broom")
Load the broom Package: Load the package into your session:

library(broom)
Retry the Command: Now, you can use tidy on your logistic regression model:

regression_results <- tidy(logit_model)
Updated Code
Here’s the updated code with the necessary fixes:


# Install and load the broom package
if (!requireNamespace("broom", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("broom")
}
library(broom)

# Extract and summarize regression results
regression_results <- tidy(logit_model)

# Compute Odds Ratios
library(dplyr)
odds_ratios <- regression_results %>%
  mutate(Odds_Ratio = exp(estimate)) %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)")

# Visualize the odds ratios
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(odds_ratios, aes(x = reorder(term, Odds_Ratio), y = Odds_Ratio)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Odds Ratios from Logistic Regression",
       x = "Variable",
       y = "Odds Ratio") +
