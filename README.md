# Delays in Toronto's Bus Network
# Overview
This repository accompanies the research paper Delays in Toronto's Bus Network: Identifying Critical Factors and Weekly Patterns. The study analyzes over 42,000 recorded incidents to determine the factors influencing delays in Toronto's bus network and provides actionable insights to improve service reliability. It leverages logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of delays based on key operational, temporal, and geographic predictors.

This repository includes the data, code, and supplementary materials used in the analysis, making it a resource for researchers, urban planners, and transit authorities interested in studying and mitigating transit delays.

# File Structure 

The repo is structured as:

- `data/raw_data`: Contains raw data sourced from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal.
- `data/analysis_data`: Includes cleaned and transformed datasets prepared for analysis.
- `models`: Contains the logistic regression model, alternative models, and validation metrics.
- `other`: Includes details about LLM usage, additional sketches, and exploratory notes.
- `paper`: Contains the final research paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography.
- `scripts`: R scripts for data cleaning, visualization, and modeling.
